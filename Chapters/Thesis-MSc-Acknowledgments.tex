I would like to thank my parents for their friendship, encouragement and caring over all these years, for always being there for me through thick and thin and without whom this project would not be possible.

I would also like to acknowledge my dissertation supervisors Prof. SÃ©rgio Guerreiro and Prof. Filipe Correia for their insight, support and sharing of knowledge that has made this Thesis possible.

Last but not least, to all my friends and colleagues that helped me grow as a person and were always there for me during the good and bad times in my life. Thank you.

To each and every one of you -- Thank you.
